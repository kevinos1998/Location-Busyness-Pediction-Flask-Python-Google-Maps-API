The research paper associated with this project is in the repository, I would reccomend reading this paper to get a clear outline of the project.

This project uses google maps API to visualise a model of location busyness on a university campus.

The model uses a large dataset of connections to the wifi network to estimate location busyness.

The model uses python, the web application is a flask application and the visualisation uses Google Maps API.
